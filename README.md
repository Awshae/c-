# C++ Training Repository

This repository documents my learning journey through core C++ programming concepts â€” from basic syntax to conditional logic and data structures.

---

## Overview

The repository is organized into the following concepts:

- C++ Basics  
- Control Structures (Conditionals and Loops)  
- Arrays and Vectors  
- Practice Programs

---

## Topics Covered

### C++ Basics
- Syntax and structure  
- Data types, keywords, identifiers, literals  
- Operators: Arithmetic, relational, logical, increment/decrement, conditional (ternary)  

### Control Structures
- Conditional statements: `if`, `if-else`, `if-else-if`, `switch`  
- Pattern printing using nested loops  

### Arrays and Vectors
- One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays  
- Introduction to `std::vector` and basic STL operations  

### Practice Programs
- Beginner-level problems  
- Logic building through simple applications
